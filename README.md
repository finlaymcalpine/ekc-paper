Project from Applied Stats class on Environmental Kuznets Curve

Paired project looking at the relationship between carbon emissions and per capita income for a collection of OECD/OECD-aligned countries, for the time period from late 90s to mid 2010s.

This was a short project, generating a short paper at the end. Purpose was to show ability to apply methods learned in class, and utilise R for statistical analysis. The code is a little verbose in places, but target was a very readable piece for anyone with knowledge of R: no read-in required.
